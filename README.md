### SEMI WORKS, ALSO SPAGHETTI HALF WORKING CODE ###

Please don't look into the source code, you won't find neat code, you'll find a held by ductape mod. 
You can however borrow my tools class, it is pretty useful for me, 1 thing though, some of the tools are already existing functions,
I just wanted to make it *feel* more custom yk.

Anyways, this mod is held by ductape, if you have any issues or ideas on how to improve this mod please go to my [discord](https://discord.gg/wR6SMnJKbt).
New features most likely won't be added, as this is the V1, I will most likely move to a V2 on a different repository. Bug fixes will be attempted to an extent, any ideas like adding crafting recipes are the ideas that will most likely be added, it won't be fully
functional with survival but I can try. Speaking of making this survival compatible, this mod it **NOT** survival compatible, it is only creative mode compatible and the mobs need to be summoned using

```/summon minecraft_modding_comments:(whatever)```.

I will try to make it survival compatible if people ask for it, so if you want me to make it survival compatible pls ask, I need to know that people would want it.
